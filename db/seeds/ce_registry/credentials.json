The passing score is based on the panel's established difficulty ratings for each exam question. under the guidance of our psychometrician, the panel develops and recommends the passing point which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Testing. The passing points for the examinations are established t identify individuals with an acceptable knowledge or a predictor of better job performance. All individuals who pass the exam, regardless of their score, have demonstrated acceptable level of knowledge.\n\nNCCT reports certification exam scores on a scale of 0 - 100, with all pass points scaled to a score of 70. The scaled score is a conversion of candidate's raw score that allows for comparison between different forms of the same examination.
