Originally a two semester program, today’s 15-week curriculum focuses on integrating the functional areas of the food industry with cutting-edge theory and practical applications needed in today’s dynamic business environment. To participate in the FIM program, students must be selected by their company and accepted by the University of Southern California for program participation. Since its founding, the WAFC, with the generous donations of food industry companies and individuals, has supported the USC Food Industry Management Program with scholarships in excess of $20 million. \n\n    In addition to the USC FIM program, the WAFC assists USC in the marketing of the USC Food Industry Management Executive Program (FIEP). Launched in 1974, this program was created for food industry executives and was originally twelve (12) Thursday night sessions held on the USC campus. Today this four day emersion in food industry concepts is offered in March and September at USC. Since 2012, the FIEP has also been offered in additional major cities in the U.S. (2012 Dallas, 2013 Chicago, 2015 Dallas).\n\n    The most recent addition to the suite of educational initiatives endorsed by the WAFC, is the “Retail Management Certificate Program” (RMCP). Introduced in partnership with Cerritos Community College in the year 2000, the RMCP is an accredited community college program available online nationally and at over 160 college campus and satellite locations in the Western United States.
