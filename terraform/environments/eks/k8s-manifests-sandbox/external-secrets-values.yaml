# Helm values for External Secrets Operator (ESO)
# ==============================================
# These values are consumed by the official Helm chart hosted at
# https://charts.external-secrets.io
#
# The file is parameterised with two placeholders that **must** be
# substituted before you run `helm upgrade --install`:
#
#   <EXTERNAL_SECRETS_ROLE_ARN> –  the IAM Role ARN that Terraform
#        outputs as `external_secrets_irsa_role_arn`.
#   <AWS_REGION>                –  the AWS region where your cluster and
#        Secrets Manager live (e.g. us-east-1).
#
# Either replace those strings manually or use `envsubst` as shown in
# the README.
