Candidates are not graded on a curve and do not compete against each other or against a quota.\n\nThis passing score for the exam is established using a panel of qualified subject matter experts who carefully review each exam questions to determine the basic level of knowledge or skill that is expected. The passing score is based on the panel's established difficulty ratings for each exam question. under the guidance of our psychometrician, the panel develops and recommends the passing point which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Testing. The passing points for the examinations are established t identify individuals with an acceptable knowledge or a predictor of better job performance. All individuals who pass the exam, regardless of their score, have demonstrated acceptable level of knowledge.\n\nNCCT reports certification exam scores on a scale of 0 - 100, with all pass points scaled to a score of 70. The scaled score is a conversion of candidate's raw score that allows for comparison between different forms of the same examination. Even if the questions on one examination form are harder or easier than on another, the same level of performance is required to meed the scaled passing score of 70 regardless of which form of the exam a candidate takes.",
