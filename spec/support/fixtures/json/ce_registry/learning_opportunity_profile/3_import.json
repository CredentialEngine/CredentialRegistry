The Commission is a fourteen-member public body created to:\n-Define the educational missions of public colleges and universities;\n-Plan and to coordinate Indiana’s state-supported system of post-high school education, taking into account the plans and interests of independent colleges and universities;\n-Review both operating budget and capital budget appropriation requests from public institutions;\n-Approve or disapprove for public institutions the establishment of any new branches, campuses, extension centers, colleges or schools;\n-Approve or disapprove for public institutions the offering of any additional associate, baccalaureate or graduate degree or certificate program of two semesters or more in duration;\n-Review all programs of public institutions and make recommendations to the governing board of the institution, the Governor, and the General -Assembly concerning the funding and the disposition of these programs; and,\n-Distribute student financial aid from state aid programs.\n\nThe Governor appoints twelve members, nine representing a Congressional District and three at-large members, to serve terms of four years. In addition, the 1990 legislature added a student and a faculty representative who are appointed by the Governor for terms of two years. The -Commission is not a governing board, but a coordinating agency that works closely with Indiana’s public and independent colleges. In addition, The Commission has strong working relationships with many other State agencies, including: Department of Education, the Department of Workforce Development, The Center for Education and Career Innovation, and the Independent Colleges of Indiana.",
